# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Your Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Mandatory

* Here, we created our own custom page utilizing basic HTML concepts combined with CSS. 

* Then, using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, we wrote a code to append a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 

  * Here, it was important that we had the necessary columns for : `date`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, `duration`, and `comment`. 

* Lastly, we used a form in the HTML and a JavaScript code that will listen for any changes/updates on the page and return rows that match the user input for the `date`. 

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* As we have completed in the last part of Level 1, we added more forms for:
  1. `date`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* This was so that the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the criteria above.
