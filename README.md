# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

A collection of data is often too large to search through manually. With that being said, being able to filter data based on user input is not only time efficient but necessary in most cases. In this assignment, we were given a dataset of UFo sightings. Our objective was to create a table and have filters based on specific values. The only coding languages used were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js on the web page.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Mandatory

* Here, we created our own custom page utilizing basic HTML concepts combined with CSS. 

* Then, using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, we wrote a code to append a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 

  * Here, it was important that we had the necessary columns for : `date`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, `duration`, and `comment`. 

* Lastly, we used a form in the HTML and a JavaScript code that will listen for any changes/updates on the page and return rows that match the user input for the `date`. 

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* As we have completed in the last part of Level 1, we added more forms for:
  1. `date`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* This was so that the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the criteria above.
